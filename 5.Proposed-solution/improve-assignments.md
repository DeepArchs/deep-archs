# Improve assignment quality

A good question or assignment helps understanding the skill level of students. An assignment that everyone does correctly or nobody is able to answer does not help the evaluation. An assignment can have an unclear formulation, with its outcomes related to a particular interpretation rather than the student skill. Assignments created by AI assisted tools include the same issues, maybe to a larger degree than the manually written ones.

Assignment quality is improved by a two-aspect system:

1. AI assisted tools that flag questions with unclear formulation. AI is tasked with checking if a question is clear and understandable by people of diverse backgrounds, and with imperfect language skills.
2. Including student feedback mechanism in the assigment itself. A simple "thumb down" button and a short instruction before the test enables students to flag questions that they feel are confusing, misleading, lack clarity, or otherwise should be improved.
