# Variations of questions in test 1

The questions in the test 1 need regular updating to prevent cheating with leaked questions or shared answers to the existing assignment.

AI model assists this task by integrating with the test maintenance server. For each question, the model offers an alternative question on the same topic together with its correct answer. A test maintenance expert can accept the alternative question as is or with manual editing. 

AI model would not help writing brand new questions, these need to be added manually.
