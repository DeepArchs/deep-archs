# Variations of questions in test 1

The questions in the test 1 need regular updating to prevent cheating with leaked questions or shared answers to the existing assignment. AI can re-phrase a question by creating an example from a different fields that validates the same skill while being worded in a different way, preventing memorisation.

AI model assists this task by integrating with the test maintenance server. For each question, the model offers an alternative question on the same topic together with its correct answer. A test maintenance expert can accept the alternative question as is or with manual editing. 

AI model will assist in generating brand new questions from a given document. AI can create candidate questions to be selected and refined by test maintainers.
