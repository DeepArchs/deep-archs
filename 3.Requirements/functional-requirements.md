# Functional Requirements

Certifiable Inc requires a comprehensive overhaul to accommodate an increased user base across multiple geographic regions. Leveraging AI is essential to manage the increased workload and ensure smooth performance. The following changes have been identified for incorporation into the processes:

**Automated Grading of Short Answer Questions in Test 1**

__*Business Objective:*__ *Reduce the time spent by administrators or examiners on manual grading. This will help decrease the workload on the administrative staff, given the anticipated increase in submissions.*

- Short answers must be analyzed for content and appropriateness, and graded based on answer quality to accurately differentiate candidate scores.
- If the grade is below a specified cutoff, key points missed in the answers should be listed, and a justification write-up should be prepared.
- The prepared justification for the low score should be saved for aggregation and subsequent candidate notification if the overall score is below the "PASS" criteria.

**Automated Evaluation of Test 2 Submissions**

__*Business Objective:*__ *Reduce the time spent by administrators or examiners on manual grading. This will help decrease the workload on the administrative staff, given the anticipated increase in submissions.*

- The entire Test 2 submission, including documents and images, should be auto-evaluated, and a score based on the quality of the submission should be generated.
- If the score is below the "PASS" cutoff, a write-up not exceeding 4000 words should be prepared to summarize the reasons for the poor score.
- All key aspects, whether positive or negative, about the submission should be generated and saved for administrative review at their discretion.

**Generation of New Question Suggestions**

__*Business Objective:*__ *Reduce the time spent by administrators or examiners on manual grading. This will help decrease the workload on the administrative staff, given the anticipated increase in submissions.*

- Administrators should be able to provide documents and request the generation of both multiple-choice and short answer questions for Test 1.
- Administrators should be able to generate case study ideas for Test 2 by providing a write-up document.

**Creation of Multiple Variants of the Same Question**

__*Business Objective:*__ *Reduce the time spent by administrators or examiners on manual grading. This will help decrease the workload on the administrative staff, given the anticipated increase in submissions.*

- Administrators should be able to create slightly modified questions by providing a sample question and asking AI to adapt it to another business domain.

**Fraud and Plagiarism Detection**

__*Business Objective:*__ *Enhance the sensitivity of the test to user fraud.*

- For Test 2, if a candidate submits a similar submission to one made by another candidate in the past or present, AI should detect it and flag it for administrative review.

_*Business Objective:*__ *Reduce administrator workload by creating suggestions for new questions and case studies.*

- Administrators should be able to input documents and receive suggestions for new multiple-choice and short answer questions.
- Administrators should be able to generate new case study ideas for Test 2 by providing a write-up document.

**Different Flavors for Questions**

__*Business Objective:*__ *Reduce administrator work by suggesting different flavors, i.e., different business domain scenarios for a selected question to increase questions with the same pattern and remove predictability of questions in exam scenarios.*

- Administrators should be able to provide a sample question and receive variations adapted to different business domains.

**Auto-Grading Options**

__*Business Objective:*__ *Reduce expert workloads by providing auto-grading options.*

- The system should provide auto-grading options for both multiple-choice and short answer questions to reduce the workload on experts.
