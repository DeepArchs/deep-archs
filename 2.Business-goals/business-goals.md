# Business Goals

## Goals

Certifiable Inc aims to enhance its system to accommodate an increased user base across multiple geographic regions. Leveraging AI is essential to manage the increased workload and ensure smooth performance. The primary goals are to improve system reliability, security, maintainability, and user experience.

## KPIs

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) will be used to measure the success of the business goals. These include:

- System uptime percentage 99.99%
- Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF) 11.4 years
- Mean Time to Repair (MTTR) 1 hr/year
- User satisfaction scores 95%
- Number of detected and mitigated security incidents 100% mitigated within 24 hours of detection
- Compliance with data privacy regulations 100%

## Goals => Objectives

### Short-term <=> Long-term Goals

- Implement AI-driven automated grading for tests to reduce manual workload.
- Enhance system security and access controls to protect sensitive data.
- Improve system reliability and availability through redundancy and failover mechanisms.
- Conduct regular usability testing to identify and address UX issues.
- Reduce administrator workload by creating suggestions for new questions and case studies.
- Reduce administrator work by suggesting different flavors, i.e., different business domain scenarios for a selected question to 
  increase questions with the same pattern and remove predictability of questions in exam scenarios.
- Reduce expert workloads by providing auto-grading options.

#### Long-term goals

- Achieve high scalability and elasticity to handle varying loads.
- Ensure global accessibility by implementing CDNs and complying with local regulations.
- Continuously update and validate AI models to maintain accuracy and relevance.
- Foster a security-aware culture through regular training and awareness programs.
- Provide high standards through auditing the results generated by the AI to maintain accuracy of results. These will act as 
  guardrails in case AI models drift and require training to avoid hallucinations. This will be a business-driven guardrail or checks 
  and balances apart from technical guardrails present.
- Provide review facilities for candidates to enhance user satisfaction and increase accuracy and maintain high standards. This will 
  also act as a business-driven guardrail or checks and balances.
- Ensure security by introducing proper checks and balances before the document submission to the AI system with the set prompts to 
  prevent wrongdoing by candidates through submissions.
- Use AI to alert experts of suspected plagiarism and fraud scenarios among submissions by candidates.

## Expected Business Outcomes

- Reduced administrative workload through automation.
