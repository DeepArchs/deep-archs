# Overview

Certifiable, Inc. is a market leader in software architecture certification. The rapid expansion of mandatory software architect licensing laws across the U.K., Europe, and Asia has led to a significant increase in demand, estimated at 5-10 times the current certification volume. The existing manual grading and administrative processes are not scalable to meet this demand.

The goal of this project is to integrate **Generative AI** into the **SoftArchCert** system to enhance certification processing, improve candidate experience, streamline administrative workflows, and ensure high credibility in certification validation. AI will play a pivotal role in **automating grading, providing candidate support, improving administrative efficiency, and detecting fraud**, while ensuring accuracy, fairness, and scalability.

## Project Scope

The AI enhancements will focus on:

- **Automated Grading**
    - AI-assisted grading for short-answer questions in the **Aptitude Test (Test 1)**.
    - AI-assisted evaluation and preliminary feedback for the **Architecture Submission (Test 2)**.

- **Candidate Support**
    - AI-driven **chatbot** for 24/7 assistance.
    - AI-generated **personalized study recommendations** and targeted practice materials.

- **Administrative Efficiency**
    - AI-driven **test analysis and question optimization**.
    - AI-generated **case study variations** to prevent content leakage.
