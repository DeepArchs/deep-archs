# **ADR-0005: Use of Amazon Neptune DB**

## **Date:**

2025-02-12

## **Status:**

Accepted

## **Context**

Certifiable Inc. is experiencing a significant increase in certification requests due to global expansion and growing demand for software architect licensing. The current database infrastructure is unable to efficiently handle the complex relationships and queries required for managing certification data, user interactions, and AI-driven functionalities. The company needs a cost-efficient, scalable, and reliable graph database to support its operations and leverage AI capabilities for automated grading and other functionalities.

The **goal** is to leverage Amazon Neptune DB to:

1. **Enhance system scalability and performance** for complex queries and relationships.
2. **Improve data reliability and availability** through managed database services.
3. **Support AI-driven functionalities** with efficient data storage and retrieval.
4. **Ensure data security and compliance** with industry standards.

## **Decision**

We will adopt **Amazon Neptune DB** for Certifiable Inc.'s database infrastructure. The solution includes:

### **1. Scalability and Performance**

- Use Amazon Neptune's fully managed graph database service to handle complex queries and relationships efficiently.
- Leverage Neptune's ability to scale read and write operations to accommodate the growing number of certification requests.

### **2. Reliability and Availability**

- Deploy Amazon Neptune in a Multi-AZ configuration to ensure high availability and minimize downtime.
- Utilize automated backups and snapshots to ensure data durability and quick recovery.

### **3. Support for AI-Driven Functionalities**

- Integrate Amazon Neptune with AWS AI services such as Amazon SageMaker for building, training, and deploying machine learning models.
- Use Neptune's graph capabilities to efficiently store and retrieve data for AI-driven functionalities like automated grading and fraud detection.

### **4. Security and Compliance**

- Implement AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) for secure access control to Neptune DB.
- Use AWS Key Management Service (KMS) for data encryption at rest and in transit.
- Conduct regular security assessments using AWS Security Hub and AWS Inspector to ensure compliance with data privacy regulations.

## **Consequences**

### **Positive Outcomes**

* [X]**Scalability:** Amazon Neptune enables seamless scaling to handle complex queries and relationships efficiently.
* [X]**Performance:** Neptune's graph database capabilities improve the performance of data storage and retrieval for AI-driven functionalities.
* [X]**Reliability:** Multi-AZ deployments and automated backups ensure high data availability and durability.
* [X]**AI Integration:** Neptune's integration with AWS AI services enhances the capabilities of automated grading and other AI-driven functionalities.
* [X]**Security:** Robust security measures and compliance with data privacy regulations protect sensitive data.

### **Risks & Mitigation**

**Risk: Vendor lock-in**
Mitigation: Use a multi-cloud strategy and design the system to be cloud-agnostic where possible.

**Risk: Cost management**
Mitigation: Implement cost monitoring and optimization tools provided by AWS to manage expenses effectively.

**Risk: Data privacy concerns**
Mitigation: Ensure compliance with data privacy regulations and use AWS data residency controls.

## **Next Steps**

- **Migrate existing database infrastructure** to Amazon Neptune DB.
- **Develop and deploy AI models** using AWS AI services integrated with Neptune.
- **Implement scalability and reliability mechanisms** using Neptune's features.
- **Conduct security assessments** and ensure compliance with data privacy regulations.
- **Monitor database performance** and optimize as needed.
