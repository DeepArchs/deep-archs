## **Status:**

Accepted

## **Context**

Certifiable Inc. is experiencing a significant increase in certification requests due to global expansion and growing demand for software architect licensing. The current AI models used for automated grading and other functionalities require frequent updates and validation to maintain accuracy and relevance. The company needs a cost-efficient, scalable, and reliable AI pattern to support its operations and leverage external knowledge sources for enhanced AI capabilities.

The **goal** is to leverage the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) AI pattern to:

1. **Enhance AI model accuracy and relevance** by leveraging external knowledge sources.
2. **Improve system scalability and performance** for AI-driven functionalities.
3. **Support AI-driven functionalities** with efficient data retrieval and generation.
4. **Ensure data security and compliance** with industry standards.

## **Decision**

We will adopt the **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) AI pattern** for Certifiable Inc.'s AI infrastructure. The solution includes:

### **1. Enhanced AI Model Accuracy and Relevance**

- Use the RAG AI pattern to combine retrieval-based and generation-based approaches for improved accuracy and relevance.
- Leverage external knowledge sources to provide up-to-date information for AI-driven functionalities.
