## **Status:**

Accepted

## **Context**

Certifiable Inc. is experiencing a significant increase in certification requests due to global expansion and growing demand for software architect licensing. The current AI models used for automated grading require frequent updates and validation to maintain accuracy and relevance. The company needs a cost-efficient, scalable, and reliable AI pattern to support its operations and enhance the accuracy and relevance of AI-driven grading.

The **goal** is to leverage the Fine-Tuning AI pattern to:

1. **Enhance AI model accuracy and relevance** by fine-tuning models with domain-specific data.
2. **Improve system scalability and performance** for AI-driven functionalities.
3. **Support AI-driven functionalities** with efficient model training and deployment.
4. **Ensure data security and compliance** with industry standards.

## **Decision**

We will adopt the **Fine-Tuning AI pattern** for Certifiable Inc.'s AI infrastructure. The solution includes:

### **1. Enhanced AI Model Accuracy and Relevance**

- Use the Fine-Tuning AI pattern to adapt pre-trained models with domain-specific data for improved accuracy and relevance.
- Regularly update and fine-tune models to maintain high performance and relevance.

### **2. Scalability and Performance**
